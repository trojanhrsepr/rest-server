## email configuration

Update settings.json file for email server configuration. Please do not leak your personal email 
addresses

You can use below services for email.

- https://ethereal.email/  Your emails are never delivered, good for testing, development
- https://mail.yandex.com don't spam

 Non-secure configuration

```json
{
    "host": "smtp.ethereal.email",
    "port": 587,
    "secure": false,  
    "auth": {
        "user": "test",  
        "pass": "pass"  
    }
}
```


 secure configuration
 
```json
{
    "host": "smtp.ethereal.email",
    "port": 465,
    "secure": true,
    "auth": {
        "user": "test",  
        "pass": "pass"  
    }
}
```

# Email example

Caution: Please create email id free for this purpose, do not leak password in the configuration file. For testing purpose, use https://ethernal.email, your email shall not be delivered, but you have have overview of it.

If you really want to send email, I would recommend to use simple services likes Yandex email services or other similar services which provides you smtp to send email, easy and quick to create, doesn’t require phone number or complex process to create email.

### Don't leak your password, you are responsible if you are victim of fraud

To send email,

    POST /api/email    
    {
    “to”: “someone@example.com”,
    “subject”: “Welcome Email”,
    “message”: “Here your messages goes”
    }

    the server respond with id of the message, and preview url if ethernal.email used.
